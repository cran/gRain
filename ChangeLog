	* In moralization, triangulation and other places, graphs are now
	represented as sparse matrices (dgCMatrix from the Matrix
	package). This means that the package can now handle much larger
	networks than before. 

	* Substantial speedup in propagation for large networks.

	* Function random_cpt added. Allows simulation of large networks.
